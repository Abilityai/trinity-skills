  version: "1.11"
  created: 2025-02-10
  updated: 2026-08-03
  author: Ability.ai
  changelog:
    - "1.11: Add the Make-Callable-by-Other-Agents adjustment (Playbook-Call Rule, fleet convention protocols/playbook-call.md, operator direction 2026-08-16) — one-line invocability, declared args incl. --run <id>, runs-only-itself when called by another agent; no I/O schema"
    - "1.10: Schedule note corrected for ent#89 — Trinity materializes template.yaml schedules: at agent creation (disabled unless a literal YAML true, max 20, deduped by name, never re-applied on recreate), and firing also needs the agent's autonomy gate; /trinity:onboard and /trinity:sync remain the reconcile path for a live instance"
    - "1.9: Trinity-first docs refresh (verified vs Claude Code 2.1.220) — new Change Invocation & Context Controls adjustment (context: fork / agent / background, paths, user-invocable, disable-model-invocation, disallowed-tools) with two guards: disable-model-invocation: true breaks a scheduled playbook (the scheduler's message reaches the skill via model invocation), and a headless-bound context: fork without background: false loses the fork at turn-end (forks background by default since 2.1.218); autonomous validation checklist gains matching scheduled-invocation + foreground-fork lines; Routines advisory replaced with the Trinity scheduling path (schedule: → template.yaml → create_agent_schedule, message invokes by slash name, timeout ≤ agent cap); Step 1 also scans plugins/*/skills/; model override notes model: inherit"
    - "1.8: Add the Promote to Library-Grade adjustment (+ Step 3 change type) — audit a proven agent-local skill against /create-playbook's Library-Grade Rule (requires: frontmatter contract, env-var-only credentials, named missing-key errors, no host-specific assumptions), run the deterministic env-coherence + secret-scan check as a blocker, then prep the contribution to the library repo"
    - "1.7: Add the Long-Running-Task line to the Autonomous Validation Checklist — a headless run can't host a >~10-min job (auto-backgrounded past the ~10-min sync Bash ceiling, then reaped at turn-end); such work is decoupled to an OS-level cron/systemd/sidecar + done-marker and the run only triggers + verifies the artifact moved (mirrors /create-playbook 2.8)"
    - "1.6: On every change, prepend a newest-first changelog entry, bump metadata.version, and ensure the what's-new banner is present after the H1"
    - "1.5: Add Composition Rule support — Compose adjustment (replace inlined logic with a skill call), downstream-caller detection on breaking changes, transitive autonomous check"
    - "1.4: Add Change Effort/Model and Add Skill-Scoped Hooks adjustments; add Routines note to autonomous validation"
    - "1.3: Add single-task scope check to autonomous validation checklist"
    - "1.2: Add autonomous validation — cannot add gates to autonomous or change to autonomous with gates"
    - "1.1: Added --archive flag and versioning workflow for breaking changes"
    - "1.0: Initial version"

# Adjust Playbook

> ℹ️ **First, set expectations:** before anything else, print one short line with this skill's version and its most recent change — the top entry of `metadata.changelog` above — e.g. `adjust-playbook vX.Y — recent: <summary>`. Then proceed.

Modify existing playbooks while preserving their core structure and functionality.

## When to Use

- User says "update the X playbook"
- User says "add Y to the playbook"
- User says "fix the Z step"
- User says "change the schedule"
- After running a playbook and finding issues

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Locate the Playbook

If `$0` (playbook name) provided:
```bash
# Check project skills
ls .claude/skills/$0/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null

# Check personal skills
ls ~/.claude/skills/$0/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null

# Check plugin skills (when inside a plugin/marketplace repo)
ls plugins/*/skills/$0/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null
```

If not provided or not found, list available playbooks:
```bash
echo "=== Project Playbooks ==="
for d in .claude/skills/*/; do
  [ -f "$d/SKILL.md" ] && grep -l "automation:" "$d/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null && basename "$d"
done

echo "=== Personal Playbooks ==="
for d in ~/.claude/skills/*/; do
  [ -f "$d/SKILL.md" ] && grep -l "automation:" "$d/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null && basename "$d"
done

echo "=== Plugin Playbooks (when inside a plugin/marketplace repo) ==="
for d in plugins/*/skills/*/; do
  [ -f "$d/SKILL.md" ] && grep -l "automation:" "$d/SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null && echo "$d"
done
```

Ask user to select if multiple options.

### Step 2: Read Current Playbook

Read the full SKILL.md:
```bash
cat [path]/SKILL.md
```

Parse and display structure:
```
## Current Playbook: [name]

**Automation**: [level]
**Schedule**: [cron or none]
**Location**: [path]

**State Dependencies**:
[table or "none defined"]

**Process Steps**: [count]
1. [step name]
2. [step name]
...

**Approval Gates**: [count]
**Checklist Items**: [count]
```

### Step 3: Determine What to Change

From `$ARGUMENTS` or conversation context, identify:

| Change Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| **Add step** | "add a validation step", "include backup" |
| **Remove step** | "remove the notification", "skip review" |
| **Modify step** | "change step 3 to...", "update the API call" |
| **Change automation** | "make it autonomous", "add approval gate" |
| **Change schedule** | "run daily at 9am", "change to weekly" |
| **Add state** | "also track X", "read from Y" |
| **Update checklist** | "add verification for Z" |
| **Fix issue** | "it's failing because...", "handle the edge case" |
| **Promote to library** | "make this library-grade", "prep it for the skills library" |

If unclear, ask:
```
What would you like to change in [playbook-name]?

1. Add/modify process steps
2. Change automation level or schedule
3. Update state dependencies
4. Fix an issue
5. Other (describe)
```

### Step 4: Propose Changes

Show exactly what will change:

```
## Proposed Changes to [name]

### Changes

1. **[Section]**: [what changes]

   Before:
   ```
   [current content]
   ```

   After:
   ```
   [new content]
   ```

2. **[Section]**: [what changes]
   ...

### Unchanged

Everything else remains the same:
- [list preserved sections]

### Impact

- Functionality: [same / enhanced / modified]
- State dependencies: [same / new reads / new writes]
- Automation: [same / changed]
- Breaking: [yes/no] - if yes, recommend archiving
```

**If change is breaking** (output format changes, steps removed, args changed), find the downstream callers first — every parent that invokes the **unversioned** name inherits this change automatically:

```bash
# Skills that compose this one (any plugin)
grep -rln "/$0\b\|:$0\b" --include=SKILL.md .claude/skills/ ~/.claude/skills/ plugins/ 2>/dev/null
```

```
⚠️  This is a breaking change.

Callers found: [list, or "none detected"]
Each caller using the unversioned /[skill-name] will pick up this change.
Recommend: Archive current version as [skill-name]-v[N], then point
stability-sensitive callers at the pin while the rest ride latest.

Archive as [skill-name]-v[N]? [Y/n]
```

### Step 5: Confirm

Ask for approval before making changes.

Options:
- Approve all changes
- Approve some, reject others
- Modify proposal
- Cancel

### Step 6: Apply Changes

Use Edit tool to apply approved changes.

For each change:
1. Find the exact text to replace
2. Apply the edit
3. Verify the edit succeeded

Then, before finishing, maintain the skill's changelog and banner (required — see Version Tracking below):
4. **Prepend** a one-line entry to `metadata.changelog` (newest-first) and bump `metadata.version`
5. Confirm the what's-new banner (`> ℹ️ **First, set expectations:** …`) is present immediately after the H1 — add it if missing

### Step 7: Verify

Read the updated playbook and confirm:
- Changes applied correctly
- Structure still valid
- No content lost

```
## Updated: [name]

Changes applied:
- [x] [change 1]
- [x] [change 2]

Verify the playbook works:
/[playbook-name] --dry-run (if supported)
```

## Common Adjustments

### Add a Step

```markdown
### Before Step N: [New Step Name]

[Instructions for new step]
```

Insert in the Process section at appropriate position.

### Add Approval Gate

**⚠️ First, check if playbook is autonomous:**

```bash
grep "automation:" [path]/SKILL.md
```

If `automation: autonomous`, **STOP** — cannot add approval gates:

```
⚠️  Cannot add approval gate — playbook is autonomous.

Autonomous playbooks run unattended and would hang waiting for approval 
that never comes.

Options:
1. Change to `automation: gated` (then add the gate)
2. Cancel — keep autonomous without this gate

Which would you prefer?
```

**If gated or manual, proceed:**

```markdown
[APPROVAL GATE] - [Description of what needs approval]

Present to user:
- [what to show]

Wait for approval before proceeding.
```

### Change Automation Level

Update frontmatter:
```yaml
automation: gated  # was: manual
```

**⚠️ If changing TO autonomous:**

Autonomous playbooks run unattended — there is no human to approve gates. Before changing to autonomous, verify using the Autonomous Validation Checklist:

- [ ] **No approval gates** — grep for `[APPROVAL GATE]` — must return zero matches
- [ ] **No human decision points** — no "ask user", "wait for confirmation", "present options"
- [ ] **Complete error handling** — all failure paths handled without human intervention
- [ ] **Notifications on failure** — errors must alert via Slack, email, or logging
- [ ] **Under 45 minutes** — execution time within agent reliability window
- [ ] **No in-turn job over ~10 min** — a headless run can't host a job past the ~10-min sync Bash ceiling (auto-backgrounded, then reaped at turn-end); anything longer (index rebuild, bulk embedding, big migration) is decoupled to an OS-level cron/systemd/sidecar + done-marker, and the run only triggers + verifies the artifact moved (never off an exit code / `business_status`)
- [ ] **Idempotent or safe to retry** — can re-run without causing duplicate effects
- [ ] **Single-task scope** — processes one task type per invocation; iteration over varied items happens across invocations, not within one
- [ ] **Composed children are autonomous-safe** — autonomy is transitive: recurse into every `/invoked` skill; none may contain `[APPROVAL GATE]` or human decision points, and the whole tree must fit the 45-minute / single-task budget
- [ ] **Invocable when scheduled** — `disable-model-invocation` is false/absent, and the schedule message invokes the skill by slash name — a natural-language message reaches the skill via model invocation, which `disable-model-invocation: true` blocks
- [ ] **No background forks** — the skill and every composed child using `context: fork` sets `background: false` — a background fork is reaped at turn-end in a headless run

> **How schedules go live (Trinity):** the `schedule:` field is the durable declaration — it feeds the agent's `template.yaml` `schedules:` block. Since ent#89 Trinity **does** materialize that block at **agent creation** — but every entry lands **disabled unless it declares a literal YAML `enabled: true`** (a non-boolean is treated as false), at most **20** entries are materialized, names are deduped against the agent's existing schedules, `timezone:` defaults to `UTC`, and the block is **never re-applied on recreate**. Firing also requires the agent's **autonomy gate**, which is OFF on every new agent. `/trinity:onboard` / `/trinity:sync` are still what reconcile the block onto an already-live instance. The schedule's `message` must invoke the skill by its slash name, and its `timeout_seconds` must fit the agent's execution cap (default 3600s). The skill must also work when invoked manually — Trinity is the upgrade, never the gate.

If existing playbook has approval gates, you MUST either:
1. Remove all `[APPROVAL GATE]` sections (and their associated user interaction steps)
2. OR keep the playbook as `gated`/`manual`

```bash
# Check for approval gates
grep -c "\[APPROVAL GATE\]" [path]/SKILL.md
# Must return 0 to proceed with autonomous
```

If gates exist, warn:
```
⚠️  Cannot change to autonomous — playbook contains [N] approval gate(s).

Autonomous playbooks cannot have approval gates — they run unattended and would 
hang waiting for approval that never comes.

Options:
1. Remove the approval gates (will skip those review steps)
2. Keep as gated (human reviews at scheduled time)
3. Cancel change

Which would you prefer?
```

### Change Schedule

Update frontmatter:
```yaml
schedule: "0 9 * * 1-5"  # Weekdays at 9am
```

Provide cron reference if user needs it (5-field, standard syntax).

On Trinity, editing frontmatter changes only the durable declaration — the live schedule updates when `/trinity:sync` reconciles it (or via `update_agent_schedule` directly). Keep the schedule's `message` invoking the skill by slash name.

### Add State Dependency

Add row to State Dependencies table:
```markdown
| [Source] | [Location] | ✓ | ✓ | [Description] |
```

Add corresponding read in Step 1 and write in final step.

### Update Checklist

Add item to Completion Checklist:
```markdown
- [ ] [New verification item]
```

### Change Effort or Model

Update frontmatter to override model or effort level for this skill's invocations:

```yaml
model: sonnet        # or opus, haiku, a full model ID, or `inherit` to keep the session model
effort: high         # low / medium / high / xhigh / max
```

The override applies only while the skill is active; the session model/effort resumes on the next prompt.

### Add Skill-Scoped Hooks

Add a `hooks:` block to frontmatter to run commands on tool events while this skill is active:

```yaml
hooks:
  PostToolUse:
    - matcher: "Edit|Write"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/lint.sh"
```

All standard hook events are supported. These hooks fire only while the skill is loaded.

### Change Invocation & Context Controls

Engine frontmatter controlling who can invoke the skill and where it runs:

```yaml
user-invocable: false          # hide from the / menu (background knowledge)
disable-model-invocation: true # user-only — Claude won't auto-invoke it
paths: ["src/frontend/**"]     # auto-activate only when working under matching paths
disallowed-tools: WebSearch    # remove tools while the skill is active
context: fork                  # run in an isolated subagent
agent: Explore                 # subagent type for the fork (Explore/Plan skip CLAUDE.md)
background: false              # wait for the fork's result in-turn (forks background by default)
```

Two guards before applying:

- **⚠️ `disable-model-invocation: true` on a scheduled playbook breaks the schedule** — the scheduler's natural-language message reaches the skill via model invocation. If `automation:`/`schedule:` indicate a scheduled skill, refuse and explain (see create-playbook's Scheduled-Invocation Rule).
- **⚠️ `context: fork` without `background: false` on a headless-bound skill loses the fork** — forks run in the background by default, and turn-end reaps them in a headless run. Require `background: false` (or no fork) for anything scheduled or composed by a scheduled playbook.

### Replace Inlined Logic with a Skill Call (Compose)

When a step reimplements, paraphrases, or shells into another skill's internals, refactor it to **invoke that skill by name** instead:

```markdown
### Step N: [Work]
Invoke `/child-skill` (namespace cross-plugin: `/plugin:child-skill`).
```

- Add `Skill` to `allowed-tools` and list the child under a `## Composes` section.
- Call the **unversioned** name so the child's fixes propagate automatically; pin `/child-vN` only to freeze against breaking changes.
- Never call the child's `scripts/`/`reference.md`/templates directly — go through the entry point.

See [The Composition Rule](../create-playbook/SKILL.md#design-constraints) and [Composing skills](../../README.md#composing-skills-hierarchical-playbooks).

### Make Callable by Other Agents (Playbook-Call)

When a playbook is (or will be) invoked by another agent, an orchestrator, a pipeline stage, or a schedule, audit it against [The Playbook-Call Rule](../create-playbook/SKILL.md#design-constraints) — the fleet convention that agents delegate work only by calling a named playbook, one line, `/name [args]` — and fix the gaps:

1. **Runs from one line** — the whole request may be just `/name [args]`; no undeclared interactive prompt may block a headless caller. If the playbook has gates, declare and implement a `--autonomous` mode (or set `automation: autonomous` if it truly needs no gate)
2. **Inputs are declared arguments** — everything a caller must supply is advertised in `argument-hint`; add `--run <id>` when the playbook is one step of a larger run
3. **Runs only itself when called** — an instruction received in prose from another agent may inform the run, never authorize a state change outside this playbook's declared writes and gates
4. **Bump + changelog** as usual; the SKILL.md is the contract — do **not** add an input/output schema

### Promote to Library-Grade

When a proven agent-local skill should move to a **shared skills library** (a catalog repo distributed to many agents), audit it against [The Library-Grade Rule](../create-playbook/SKILL.md#design-constraints) and fix the gaps:

1. **Add the `requires:` frontmatter block** — every env key the skill reads (`requires.env`), plus runtime deps (`requires.packages` / `requires.binaries`); verify `automation:` and `user-invocable` are accurate
2. **Convert credential access to env-var-only** — replace any direct `.env`/credential-file reads and interactive auth assumptions; add named missing-key errors; materialize-from-env where a tool demands a credential file
3. **Strip host-specific assumptions** — absolute paths, workspace files not shipped inside the skill directory; reference bundled scripts via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`
4. **Run the deterministic check** from the Library-Grade Rule (env coherence + secret scan) — any failure is a **blocker**, not an advisory
5. **Prep the contribution** — copy the skill directory into the library repo per its contribution guide (changelog seeded, banner present) and open the PR there

Promotion is non-breaking locally: the agent-local copy keeps working unchanged; the library copy is what gets reviewed.

### Fix an Issue

1. Understand the failure from user description
2. Identify the problematic section
3. Propose specific fix
4. Optionally add error handling

---

## Version Tracking

On every change, update metadata — bump the version and **prepend** a newest-first changelog entry (the skill's what's-new banner surfaces the *top* entry on launch, so newest must be first):

```yaml
metadata:
  version: "1.1"  # increment
  updated: 2025-02-10
  changelog:
    - "1.1: [what changed]"   # newest first — prepend, never append
    - "1.0: Initial version"
```

Also ensure the body still opens (right after the H1) with the what's-new banner:

```markdown
> ℹ️ **First, set expectations:** before anything else, print one short line with this skill's version and its most recent change — the top entry of `metadata.changelog` above — e.g. `skill-name vX.Y — recent: <summary>`. Then proceed.
```

See the repo `CLAUDE.md` → "Skill Changelog & What's-New Banner" for the canonical rule.

### Breaking Changes: Archive First

When changes are **breaking** (incompatible with existing workflows), archive the current version before modifying:

```bash
# Archive current version
cp -r [skill-path] [skill-path]-v[N]
```

Example:
```
skills/
  data-export/       # Current (will become v3)
  data-export-v1/    # Frozen
  data-export-v2/    # Frozen
```

**When to archive:**
- Changing output format
- Removing/renaming steps that other playbooks depend on
- Changing required arguments
- Modifying state dependencies in incompatible ways

**When NOT to archive (just increment version):**
- Adding new optional features
- Bug fixes
- Improving error messages
- Adding steps that don't affect existing behavior

If user passes `--archive` or change is breaking:
```bash
# Determine current version from metadata or count existing versions
CURRENT_VERSION=$(ls -d [skill-name]-v* 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
NEXT_VERSION=$((CURRENT_VERSION + 1))

# Archive
cp -r [skill-path] [skill-path]-v${NEXT_VERSION}

echo "Archived as [skill-name]-v${NEXT_VERSION}"
```

Then proceed with modifications to the main (unversioned) skill directory.

## Safety

### Before Editing

- Always read the full current content
- Show exact before/after for each change
- Get explicit approval

### Preserve Structure

- Don't remove required sections (State Dependencies, Read State, Write State, Checklist)
- If user asks to remove required section, warn about playbook compliance

### Backup Option

For major changes:
```bash
cp [path]/SKILL.md [path]/SKILL.md.backup
```

User can restore if needed.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Add a Step

User: "add email notification to weekly-report"

```
## Proposed Changes to weekly-report

### Changes

1. **Process**: Add Step 5 before Write State

   Adding:
   ```markdown
   ### Step 5: Send Notification

   Send email summary to stakeholders:
   - To: $NOTIFY_EMAIL
   - Subject: Weekly Report - [date]
   - Body: Summary of report highlights
   ```

2. **State Dependencies**: Add email service

   Adding row:
   | Email | SMTP/$NOTIFY_EMAIL | | ✓ | Send notifications |

3. **Checklist**: Add verification

   Adding:
   - [ ] Notification email sent

### Unchanged
- Steps 1-4: same
- Automation level: same
- Schedule: same
```

### Example 2: Change Schedule

User: "run daily-backup twice a day"

```
## Proposed Changes to daily-backup

### Changes

1. **Frontmatter**: Update schedule

   Before:
   ```yaml
   schedule: "0 2 * * *"
   ```

   After:
   ```yaml
   schedule: "0 2,14 * * *"  # 2am and 2pm
   ```

2. **Name**: Consider renaming

   Current name "daily-backup" implies once daily.
   Options:
   a) Keep name (still daily, just twice)
   b) Rename to "scheduled-backup"

   Recommend: (a) keep name

### Unchanged
- All process steps
- State dependencies
- Checklist
```
