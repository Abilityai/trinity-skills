# Workspace Organization Discipline

**NEVER create files in the agent's root directory.** Before creating ANY file or asset, determine the proper location.

## Location Decision Tree

Before using Write or Bash to create files, follow this decision tree:

### 1. Is this persistent project work?
**YES** -> `docs/` or project-specific folder (git-tracked)
- Documentation
- Strategies and plans
- Process documentation
- Project deliverables

### 2. Is this a generated asset?
**YES** -> Within relevant subfolder structure
- Diagrams -> `assets/visuals/`
- Analysis -> `assets/analysis/`
- Reports -> `assets/reports/`

### 3. Is this session-specific temporary work?
**YES** -> `session-files/YYYY-MM-DD_activity/`
- Drafts before sending
- One-off artifacts
- Temporary outputs
- Meeting prep materials

### 4. Is this a script or utility?
**YES** -> `scripts/[functional-area]/`
- Code files
- Automation scripts
- Integration utilities

### 5. Is this a multi-session project initiative?
**YES** -> `projects/[project-name]/`
- Ongoing initiatives
- Multi-session work
- Project-specific materials

## File Naming Convention

**Always use snake_case**: `lowercase_with_underscores.ext`

Examples:
- `meeting_notes_2025_01_25.md`
- `sales_analysis_q4.json`
- `contact_enrichment_report.txt`

## Session Files Structure

```
session-files/
  YYYY-MM-DD_activity_name/
    drafts/
    outputs/
    notes.md
```

Create dated activity folders: `2025-01-25_client_outreach`

## Before Write/Bash Operations - CHECKLIST

1. **Identify context**: Project-related, session-specific, or script/utility?
2. **Check existing structure**: Does appropriate subfolder exist?
3. **Place in proper location**: Never root directory
4. **When in doubt**: ASK before creating in root

## What Goes Where - Quick Reference

| File Type | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| Email drafts | `session-files/YYYY-MM-DD_activity/drafts/` |
| Reports | `session-files/YYYY-MM-DD_activity/outputs/` or `assets/reports/` |
| Scripts | `scripts/[functional-area]/` |
| Documentation | `docs/[area]/` |
| Project materials | `projects/[project-name]/` |
| Meeting prep | `session-files/YYYY-MM-DD_meeting-prep/` |

## Delivering Generated Files

When creating files by user request, after saving:
1. Provide the full path to the output folder
2. Open it in Finder (macOS): `open /path/to/folder`

## Root Directory - NEVER Place Here

These should NEVER be in root:
- Generated reports
- Draft documents
- Analysis outputs
- Temporary files
- Session artifacts

**Root directory discipline is non-negotiable.**

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User requests file in root | Explain policy, suggest appropriate location, ask for confirmation |
| Unsure about file category | Ask user for clarification before creating |
| Required folder doesn't exist | Create the folder structure first, then write file |
| File already exists at location | Ask user: overwrite, rename, or choose new location |
| Path contains invalid characters | Sanitize filename using snake_case convention |

## Customization

Edit this skill to match your workspace structure. Replace folder names with your preferred organization:

```
your-agent/
  docs/           # Persistent documentation
  scripts/        # Utility scripts
  assets/         # Generated assets (reports, visuals)
  projects/       # Multi-session project work
  session-files/  # Temporary session outputs
```
